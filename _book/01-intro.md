#   Overview 

##   The book 
 
Spatial Temporal Methods in Environmental Epidemiology with R and, like its first Edition, explores the interface between environmental epidemiology and spatio-temporal modelling. It links recent developments in spatio-temporal theory with epidemiological applications. Drawing on real-life problems, it shows how recent advances in methodology, can assess the health risks associated with environmental hazards. The book's clear guidelines enable the implementation of the methodology and estimation of risks in practice.
 
The text covers a wide range of topics from epidemiological principles to the foundations of spatio-temporal modelling. New and current research directions are explored. Traditional and Bayesian approaches are presented. Practical examples demonstrate how with listed computer code information may be gleaned from data and uncertainty reduced. Supplementary material is presented in R Bookdown, located in a GitHub site. There, the reader will find amongst other things: additional code; data; other examples;, exercises; lab projects. 

Features
1. Explores the interface between environmental epidemiology and spatioÂ¬ temporal modelling
 Incorporates examples that show how spatio-temporal methodology can inform societal concerns about the effects of environmental hazards on health
2. Uses a Bayesian foundation on which to build an integrated approach to spatio-temporal modelling and environmental epidemiology
3. Discusses data analysis and topics such as data visualization, mapping, wrangling and analysis
4. Shows how to design networks for monitoring hazardous environmental processes networks and the ill-effects of preferential sampling
5. Through the listing and application of code, shows the power of R, tidyverse, NIMBLE and Stan and other modern tools can provide information that reduces uncertainty.

Representing a major direction in environmental epidemiology, this book-in full color throughout -- underscores the increasing need to consider dependencies in both space and time when modelling epidemiological data. Readers will learn how to identify and model patterns in spatio-temporal data as well as exploit dependencies over space and time to reduce bias and inefficiency.
